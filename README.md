1. Read the Linux kernel code style doc;
2. Write the swap16, swap32, swap64 functions that swap bytes in uint16_t, uint32_t, uint4_t (endiannes conversions);
3. Write a function than converts the RGB888 data format to RGB565
4. Write a program that gets two values from a user: height and width of a rectangle in meters and calculates
and prints the perimeter and the area of the rectangle in inches.
5. Write a program that computes the perimeter and the area of a circle with a radius of 6
6. Write a  program that  computes the factorial of 10
7. Write a program that prints all integer numbers between 1 to 500 which are divisible by a number
received from a user.

1. Write a function that finds the biggest element in an array of ints.
2. Create a linked list library with functions list_add(), list_contains(), list_remove(). Elements in
a list should be dynamically allocated.
3. Create integer array library with functions ar_push(), ar_find_first(), ar_remove(). Array
should be allocated dynamically. The ar_push() function adds a new element after the last one;
ar_find_first() returns the positive index of the first occurance of the given element in the array or -1
of the number is not in the array; ar_remove() removes element by it's index. Order of elements in an
array is not important;

1. Write a function that copies a string to a new one dynamically allocated. The function should return the 
new string address or NULL in case of error. Avoid using the standart functions from string.h
2. Write a stack library based on a linked list. Minimum set of operations: push(), pop();
3. Write a queue lbrary based on an array. Minimum set of operations: enqueue(), dequeue();
4. Write the "map" function that receives an array of items, its size, and a function to apply to each item
of the array. "map" could modifu existing array or return a new one.
5. [OPTIONAL] Explain how the code from the title slide works (or unfold the code in text, make it simpler).
